<p>Project: Impulses is a personal finance app that analyzes the bank transactions of a user and identifies nonessential spending habits, like buying a latte in the morning, that could easily be saved. The app allows the users to set up custom rule-based reminders (which would be later referred to as “Habits”) to save rather than spend money on that purchase. This step will allow us to send the user a text at a time specified by the user to suggest saving that money rather than spending it. Users are able to make the deposit of the savings via a simple yes/no response to the text message and the “coffee money” would be automatically drawn from the user’s account and deposited into a savings/investment account. Users can also set a saving goal each month/quarter via the app and those who achieve their saving goals by the end of the month/quarter will be entered into a lottery for a chance to win an ipad/gift card. The end goal of this product is to engage proactively with users to promote personal savings by encouraging small changes in day to day spending behavior. </p>
